    "blog-content": "The remarkable thing about the Beetle is not just the sheer number of sales, but the fact that a car developed from an idea of Adolf Hitler’s was to become as loved by Californian surf dudes, college kids and free lovin’ hippies as it was desired by fervent Nazis. Herbie – the anthropomorphic star of six Hollywood movies beginning with The Love Bug in 1968 – was the same car German families had saved up for before Hitler’s invasion of Poland dashed their hopes. \n Ultimately, the sheer quality, along with the affordability, reliability, economy and distinct look and feel of the Beetle, ensured its success. It had, though, been touch and go for Volkswagen in 1945. Although the car had been on the drawing board since 1934, following a meeting between Hitler and Porsche, the Volkswagen failed to get into production before the war. \n The idea had been for a small saloon that could carry a German family of five flat-out at 100kph along the country’s new autobahns. It was to have cost 990 Reich Marks, which represented 31 weeks’ pay for the average German worker in 1936, making it cheaper than the £100 Fords being made in England (31 weeks pay for the average British worker in 1936 was about £100). To buy one, however, members of the Volk had to join a special savings scheme run by the organisation KdF (Kraft durch Freude, or Strength through Joy); from 1938, the Volkswagen was officially named the KdF Wagen. \n There was little joy, though, in rival engineering camps. The Czech car company, Tatra, claimed that Porsche had infringed several design patents, notably those by Hans Ledwinka, an Austrian engineer much admired by Hitler. Tatra took legal action, but Hitler invaded Austria, seized its factory and banned Ledwinka’s VW-like prototypes from public show. In 1961, however, VW made a substantial payment to Tatra through an out-of-court settlement. By then, though, Volkswagen had conquered the world. \n In 1945, factory and car had been saved by Major Ivan Hirst, a British army officer and engineer. Hirst had witnessed first hand the sheer quality of VW-based military vehicles during the war and believed that, once in production, a peacetime Beetle would have an appeal well beyond Germany.",

    "title": "How Ferrari became one of the world’s most powerful brands",
    "websiteUrl": "#",
    "blog-content": "n 1947, the first Ferrari emerged from the brand’s Italian factory. On Via Acetone Inferiore in Maranello, the 125 S rolled off the production line, and it embodied the passion and determination of Enzo Ferrari, the company’s founder. \n Ferrari, who was born in Modena in 1898, and died in 1988, devoted his entire life to designing and building the most beautiful sports cars in the world and delivering them to the road and the track Beginning his career with Alfa Romeo, the Italian soon branched out to create his own company – and made supercar history in the process. \n  So, when we ask ‘How did Ferrari become one of the world’s most powerful brands?’ the answer seems simple. Surely it was the dedication and enthusiasm of Enzo Ferrari? But there is more to the story of these supercars than one man and, from the iconic logo to being backed by Fiat, these are the reasons Ferrari has always stayed on top. \n In the world of motoring, there is no logo so iconic as Ferrari’s Prancing Horse. Audi’s 4 rings come close, as does Mercedes’ three-pronged star, but the equine emblem of Italy’s foremost supercar manufacturer is in a league of its own. And this level of brand recognition is the first reason that Ferrari is one of the world’s most powerful brands. \n  Enzo Ferrari told the story of this logo just once. “The horse was painted on the fuselage of the fighter plane of Francesco Baracca,” said the automaker, “a heroic airman of the first world war. In 1923, I met count Enrico Baracca, the hero’s father, and then his mother, countess Paulina, who said to me one day, ‘Ferrari, put my son’s prancing horse on your cars. It will bring you good luck’. The horse was, and still is, black, and I added the canary yellow background which is the colour of Modena.”\n Now a trademark of Ferrari, the horse is synonymous with power and grace – and is said to bring luck to anyone who’s vehicle bears the emblem.
